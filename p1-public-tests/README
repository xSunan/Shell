To get going on the tests, put two files (run-tests.csh and para.c) and 
a directory (scripts) into your current project directory:

Compile para.c:
  gcc -Wall -o para para.c

Create a directory to store oracle restuls
  mkdir results

To run all the tests, simply type:

  ./run-tests.csh

To run a specific test, type:

  ./run-tests.csh <testNumber>

as in

  ./run-tests.csh 12

Running a specific test may be useful to debug a particular problem you
are having. 

Here are some short descriptions of what the released tests are supposed to check:

 0 too many command-line arguments

 14 multiple commands separted by ";"
 15 multiple commands with ";", tabs and spaces
